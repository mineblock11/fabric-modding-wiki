# Miscellaneous Topics - About This Section

The miscellaneous topics section contains a variety of topics that don't fit into any other category, or are too small to warrant their own section but are still considered worthy of being documented on the wiki.

These topics are not ordered in any particular way, and can be read in any order, and usually aren't version specific.
