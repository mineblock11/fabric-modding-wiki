# Playing SoundEvents

Minecraft has a big selection of sounds which you can choose from. Check out the `SoundEvents` class to view all the vanilla sound event instances that Mojang has provided.

## Using sounds in your mod

Make sure to execute the `playSound()` method on the logical server side when using sounds!

In this example, the `useOnEntity()` and `useOnBlock()` method for a custom [interactive Item](/items/interactivity) is used to play a "placing copper block" and a pillager sound.

```java
    @Override
    public ActionResult useOnEntity(ItemStack stack, PlayerEntity user, LivingEntity entity, Hand hand) {
        // As stated above, don't use the playSound() mothod on the client side - it wont work!
        if (!entity.getWorld().isClient()) {
            // Play the sound as if it was coming from the entity.
            entity.playSound(SoundEvents.ENTITY_PILLAGER_AMBIENT, 2f, 0.7f);
        }
        return super.useOnEntity(stack, user, entity, hand);
    }

```

The `playSound()` method is used with the `LivingEntity` object. Only the SoundEvent, the volume and the pitch need to be specified. You can also use the `playSound()`  method from the world instance to have a higher level of control.

```java
    @Override
    public ActionResult useOnBlock(ItemUsageContext context) {
        // Tipp of the day: Check out "Guard Clauses" to keep your code clean.
        if (!context.getWorld().isClient()) {
            // Play the sound and specify location, category and who made the sound.
            // No entity made the sound, so we specify null.
            context.getWorld().playSound(null, context.getBlockPos(), 
                    SoundEvents.BLOCK_COPPER_PLACE, SoundCategory.PLAYERS, 
                    1f, 1f);
        }        
        return super.useOnBlock(context);
    }
```

### SoundEvent and SoundCategory

The SoundEvent defines which sound will be played. You can also [register your own SoundEvents](/sounds/) to include your own sound.

Minecraft has several audio sliders in the in-game settings. The `SoundCategory` enum is used to determine which slider will adjust your sound's volume.

### Volume and Pitch

The volume parameter can be a bit misleading. In the range of `0.0f - 1.0f` the actual volume of the sound can be changed. If the number gets bigger than that, the volume of `1.0f` will be used and only the distance, in which your sound can be heard, gets adjusted. The block distance can be roughly calculated by `volume * 16`.

The pitch parameter increases or decreases the pitch value and also changes the duration of the sound. In the range of `(0.5f - 1.0f)` the pitch and the speed gets decreased, while bigger numbers will increase the pitch and the speed. Numbers below `0.5f` will stay at the pitch value of `0.5f`.
